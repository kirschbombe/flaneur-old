desc: "The La Brea Tar Pits have become a big attraction of the Los Angeles area, but during the early nineteenth century, the tar, or brea, was mined commercially and used as a resource throughout the state of California. The few bones discovered were tossed aside and not given much thought; however, the importance of the fossils were recognized in 1875 when Henry Hancock presented a tooth of a saber-toothed cat."

This postcard portrays the elephant remains that were found in Pit 9 at the La Brea Tar pits.  For thousands of years the naturally occurring tar has preserved the animal remains. Animals became victims of the tar when they would get too close and fall into the sticky goo.  It would suck the animals in and they would die, their remains would be left to be discovered by archaeologists today (McNassor 11). Sloths, elephants, mammoths, and saber-toothed cats are just some of the species that have been discovered in the pits. In the case of pit number 9, cracks in the earth allowed hydrogen sulfide, methane gas, and liquid asphalt to seep into the pits; remains started to deteriorate because of water from a natural spring that came in contact with the asphalt (McNassor 9 and 33).

The La Brea Tar Pits have become a big attraction of the Los Angeles area, but during the early nineteenth century, the tar, or brea, was mined commercially and used as a resource throughout the state of California. The few bones discovered were tossed aside and not given much thought; however, the importance of the fossils were recognized in 1875 when Henry Hancock presented a tooth of a saber-toothed cat (Harris and Jefferson 2).

Prehistoric animals that inhabited Los Angeles about eleven thousand years ago began to be investigated at Rancho La Brea in 1901. This vast piece of land was owned by the Hancock family, and with their permission, paleontologists were able to excavate the bones. Hancock donated the findings and land to the County of Los Angeles  in May of 1915. The surrounding area is rightfully named in his honor as the Hancock Park.

In 1913, the Los Angeles County Museum of History, Science, and Art (which later became the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County), launched a two-year excavation project that recovered a million fossilized bones from 96 quarries, later known as pits.  The remains of several of these excavations are still on view to the public, including Pits 3, 4, 9, 13, 61, 67, and 91. Pit 9 was excavated from November 18, 1913 to September 9, 1914 to a final depth of 35 feet into the ground. It is located immediately north of the Pit 91 compound. Over 10,000 fossils were recovered from this site, including those from a short-faced bear, an American lion, mastodons, saber toothed cats, dire wolves, camels, horses and ground sloths. Most importantly, Pit 9 is Rancho La Brea's main locality for Columbian mammoths. Most of the elephant remains that were excavated from the tar pits were discovered in Pit 9 (“Page Museum: La Brea Tar Pits”). Though this excavation site provided the remains of both the Columbian mammoth and American mastodon, the deteriorated remains disappointed scientists as so many of the artifacts were brutally damaged from the natural elements.

Once removed from the tar pits, the larger of the fossils were brought to a laboratory after excavation to be cleaned by hand. They were cleared of most of the tar as well as sand and clay deposits. A solvent was been created to dissolve the asphalt. Each fossil was placed in ultrasonic tanks where high-frequency sound waves aided the solvent in removing the asphaltic sediments (Harris and Jefferson 14).

The bones were usually not part of the same organism. In fact, until 1975, when George C. Page donated money to build Page Museum, the remains were only identified through guessing. After cleaning, the fossils were passed on to people who piece them together.  Once documentation was finished, the fossils were catalogued and curated, then displayed in an exhibit in museums.

Built adjacent to the La Brea Tar Pits, The Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Its proposed renovation, which includes modeling a building after a splatter of tar, would harm the tar pits. The museum’s roof design would block light and rain that could interfere with   natural processes and vegetation. As of now, the project is still in its early stages, and further plans will be made while considering the impact to the environment.
