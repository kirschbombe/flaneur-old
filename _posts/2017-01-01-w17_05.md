Have you ever seen such photogenic animals? The lion, elephant and alligators displayed in these photographs were accustomed to shining in the spotlight; in fact, these animals were some of the world’s first filmed actors. The workplace and living quarters of such celebrities was located in Los Angeles, California at the Selig-Jungle-Zoo. William Selig, the founder and owner of the zoo, attracted tourists from across the United States with the opportunity to witness the production of motion-pictures. This, combined with the appeal of exotic animals, charmed the public. From its opening in 1915 to its closure in 1938, the zoo contributed greatly to the culture of Los Angeles and the progression of film production.

Spoken language, body language, music and writing are recognized as forms of communicative expression that have been adopted through time. In the modern age, the motion-picture prevails as one of the most widely used and impactful forms of communication. 1894 marked a milestone in history; Thomas Edison's Kinetoscope was commercially introduced (Erish). This nascent, coin-operated, form of technology allowed customers to view a one-minute film through a peephole in a wooden cabinet, and its construction revolutionized William Selig’s life.

Selig (1864-1948) was a member of a traveling minstrel troupe, and his experience in the entertainment industry led him to realize the potential of motion-pictures (Erish). He capitalized on this new industry by creating a projector, completed in April 1897, to screen longer films to larger audiences (Erish). Films shown in theaters, rather than through a peephole in a wooden box, could yield larger profits. Following his invention, Selig leased an office in downtown Chicago to produce films. Within months, he launched his business into prosperity with his production of the minute-and-a-half-long comedy The Tramp and the Dog (Erish). The profits allowed Selig to expand his operation by leasing an entire building for production. Inside were general offices, printing laboratories and machine shops for building sets and props (Erish). Additionally, Selig dominated the production market with the sale of his Polyscope Projector; he vertically integrated his business and successfully ran a monopoly in the motion-picture industry (Erish).

In March 1909, upon the conclusion of his presidency, Teddy Roosevelt announced a year-long African expedition to collect bird and mammal specimens for the Smithsonian Institute (Ascárate). Enticed by the public's interest, Selig proposed documenting the safari, but the Smithsonian banned recording the trip (Ascárate). Weeks later, Selig read in a newspaper that Cherry Kearton, a wildlife photographer, was given permission to film Roosevelt’s adventure (Erish). Infuriated, Selig decided to produce his own footage of a Roosevelt look-a-like traveling through the “African grasslands” (Erish). Selig’s friend gave him the contact information of an  exotic-animal circus in Wisconsin. Selig then traveled back to his Chicago studio and began constructing a jungle set with flora, provided by local greenhouses, to complement the African fauna (Erish). Soon enough, Hunting Big Game in Africa was complete. Although the film was shot entirely in the United States, it was met with an incredible reception at the box office (Erish).

The positive public response to the jungle film encouraged Selig to continue producing jungle-themed movies, but by August of 1911, Selig’s collection of animals had outgrown the Chicago studio. The expanding menagerie was relocated to a 32 acre tract of land east of downtown Los Angeles (Erish). Selig’s innovative, business-oriented mindset guided Southern California towards becoming the cinematic hotspot by paying several Midwest newspapers to print advertisements of a cross-country, film-fanatic expedition. The publications promoted his company through illustrating Los Angeles as the mythic and geographic film production capital of the nation (Afra). For a price of $128, about $3,100 today, individuals had the ability to embark on a two week train journey from Chicago to California to meet (human) actors, witness the shooting of upcoming movies and visit the newly opened Selig-Jungle-Zoo (Afra).

The zoo officially opened on June 20th, 1915 and was popular among local residents and tourists. 150,000 paid admissions were recorded in the first seven months (Erish). All animals used within Selig’s films resided here, and the property doubled as the shooting location of many productions (Afra). Masterfully sculpted, giant concrete statues of lions and elephants guarded the zoo’s main entrance and greeted admiring visitors, soon becoming emblems of the zoo (When Elephants Ruled...).

Lions and elephants, sculpted or real, could not protect the film market from the devastating effects of World War I. By 1918, the war, along with increased competition among private producers, forced Selig out of the production industry. In response, he shifted focus to expanding his zoo (Afra). In 1922, Selig announced a $2,000,000 renovation plan that included attractions such as a Ferris wheel, loop-the-loops and a carousel (Big Pleasure Park Planned). His plans never came to fruition, and the land was eventually sold for $474,000 to RC Durant, who renamed it Luna Park Zoo (Erish). A torrent of rain hit the area in 1938 causing irreparable storm and flood damage to the property, and as a result, the zoo was closed permanently (Erish).

Following its closure, Selig auctioned off some animals to production companies, such as MGM’s iconic roaring lion, and donated many to the Griffith Park Zoo, the foundation of today’s LA Zoo (Erish). In 2009, the lions and elephants that once welcomed Selig Zoo guests were recovered from a junkyard and restored for display at the Los Angeles Zoo as artifacts of the cinematic revolution. Today, in the neighborhood of Lincoln Park at the intersection of Selig Place and Mission Road lies the former entrance to the Selig-Jungle-Zoo. Following its closure, a piece of the land was converted to a lake and a park, which continues to provide a space for the public to enjoy.
