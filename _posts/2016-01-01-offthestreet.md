The catalog below is a documentation of the exhibition, Off the Street, curated by Fritz A. Frauchiger, who organized this event with one major intention: to bring together Los Angeles, its artists, and its people.  The connection of these three components brought more awareness to the large subculture of artists otherwise unrecognized in Los Angeles. All 48 artists drew inspiration from Los Angeles and environs; Frauchiger’s goal was to give them a space in their city to present their work, and the people a chance to view it.  Not only did he give the artists this opportunity, but also he used the city-owned building in a cultural way before its demolition. Once home to the city’s Print Shop, it became a victim of the newly-implemented earthquake codes, but all decisions on the building’s fate were preempted in order to allow this exhibition to be installed within.  This show, and this very catalog, would not have been possible without the many contributions of city businesses: Harry Montgomery of Typecraft Inc. provided free printing for the catalog, Don Morgan of Type Works donated the typesetting, Standard Brands Paint Co. donated paint for the walls, Martin Steel of Aesthetic Frame Design donated glass, Howard Redding of Roark Graphic Supplies donated artists’ supplies, and Larry Albright loaned neon light for the space. This exhibition was truly a collaborative piece in and of itself, put together by the City of Los Angeles and its cultural devotees.

Specific artists who participated in Off the Street included Brian Tucker, Dennis Callwood, Stephen Berens, and Neal Taylor.  These contributors worked in styles that emulated the city’s activity and its powerful aura.  As Fred Croton (the General Manager of the Cultural Affairs Department of the City of Los Angeles) states, they all had a “desire to work with a perceived impression, which, taken back to studio or workshop can be distilled and reborn according to the artist’s bent.”  This exhibition put artists in Angeleno’s minds, and artists gained something essential: public awareness.

Among the 48 artists, two in particular reflected the hip-hop cultural movement by incorporating graffiti in their exhibition pieces. The exhibition opened in early 1985, a few years after graffiti reached Los Angeles. Although this medium was originally used by neighborhood gangs, it began to evolve as emerging artists assimilated it to their own art. Brian Tucker, whose Real Life Ain’t This Way (1984), takes a unique approach of combining graffiti, house-paint, and acrylic into each of his paintings. Tucker strives to paint the truth by capturing the person in the picture, the object they are holding, and the viewer that is reacting to the image. Tucker combines graffiti with other styles similar to how he combines both his philosophies and emotions onto one canvas. Photographer and graffiti artist Denis Callwood captured the photos featured in the exhibition with names such as, Man with Trumpet (1984) and Child Facing Wall (1984). Callwood made these seemingly generic pictures unparalleled by spray painting the finished photograph. Long after the exhibit ended, Callwood continued to spread his art to those he believed needed it the most. For nearly thirty years, he worked with inmates to channel graffiti skills into expressing their thoughts artistically, rather than vandalizing public property. With Callwood’s guidance, many convicts found a new outlook on life by using graffiti to release their emotions onto a canvas. Even though Tucker and Callwood use graffiti in their artwork in different ways, the art exhibition showcased their uses of this style to send powerful messages and inspiration for others.

In addition to Tucker and Callwood, Stephen Berens and Neal Taylor created profound work that reflected the Los Angeles lifestyle.  Berens specializes in photography, although with the photographs displayed in Off the Street, he included other media such as oil stick and pencil.  His photographs at the time of the show mainly focused around “genre scenes” or documenting places and/or events in the Los Angeles area.  His work is presently in the collection of a number of institutions around the country and he continues to experiment with photography in images of different places around the world.  Neal Taylor works in collage, capturing the faces of American Pop Culture.  His work is inspired by other artists’ lives - by people who have a story to tell. He spends countless hours choosing what material he wants to cut up to portray the chosen celebrity, but he also illustrates children’s books, freelances as a graphic designer, and works in advertising.  His work continues to portray the many people he finds with the most stories to tell and to this day attempts to expose their true, larger-than-life characters.

The art exhibition, Off the Streets, was created simply for artists, such as the four discussed, to have the opportunity to showcase their work to the city. The City’s Print Shop became of great significance in 1985 when its old, abandoned walls held this once in a lifetime art exhibit. The only trace left of the exhibition can be found in this catalog, “Off the Street.” From the ashes of the print shop rose the Japanese American National Museum, which still stands today in Little Tokyo. The museum continues to showcase photos and pieces of artwork pertaining to Japanese-American culture, similar to how the art exhibition did with artwork pertaining to modern culture at the time. Even though the original building of this exhibit no longer exists, the site itself holds historical significance and the artwork still endures and remains accessible in the catalog.
