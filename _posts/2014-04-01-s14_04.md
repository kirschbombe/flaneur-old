desc: "The United States has seen countless urban uprisings, among which the most severe and tragic were the Rodney King Riots in 1992. The Riots can be studied in several ways. One way to analyze the event is through this photograph, which was taken on Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard. The image shows about forty people, who appear to be minorities, on the ground with their hands tied behind their backs. Some are lying completely flat, while others are kneeling or sitting on the wet cement. About eight police officers with masks and weapons are keeping watch. Behind the officers is a graffiti-covered wall with words like “Fuck Police” and “1992”. The image provides a visual summary of the riots and the relationship between the local authority and the Los Angeles minorities."

The United States has seen countless urban uprisings, among which the most severe and tragic were the Rodney King Riots in 1992. The Riots can be studied in several ways. One way to analyze the event is through this photograph, which was taken on Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard. The image shows about forty people, who appear to be minorities, on the ground with their hands tied behind their backs. Some are lying completely flat, while others are kneeling or sitting on the wet cement. About eight police officers with masks and weapons are keeping watch. Behind the officers is a graffiti-covered wall with words like “Fuck Police” and “1992”. The image provides a visual summary of the riots and the relationship between the local authority and the Los Angeles minorities.

Los Angeles has been a very diverse place, and there has always been a separation between ethnicities in the city. The beginning of World War II attracted many people to Los Angeles, many of whom could only find affordable housing in areas such as Watts, Green Meadows, and Willowbrook. The African American population in Los Angeles grew by about 299,866 people from 1940 to 1950 (Collins, 7). By 1990, Los Angeles County had more African Americans and more Hispanics than the neighboring counties (Waldinger, 115). Of the 94,671 people living in Watts and the surrounding areas, 54,654 people were African American while 38,418 were Hispanic (Los Angeles Department of City Planning). In contrast to the large Hispanic and African American population, only 850 people were White Americans (Los Angeles Department of City Planning). The demographics of South Central during that time explains why the picture of the riots shows the police arresting a large group of African Americans and Hispanics instead of a more diverse-race group. Most of the people living there were minorities that suffered from inequalities that plagued the area.

The tension between the African American and White American communities had been present for a long time, and the grim economic outlook of the South Central Area only escalated the tension even more. After World War II, Los Angeles underwent a drastic restructuring: traditional and high-wage manufacturing employment declined rapidly, while high-technology and craft-specialty started to grow. As a result, between 1978 and 1982, 70,000 well-paying and stable industrial jobs disappeared from South Central (Gooding-Williams, 127). As jobs became scarce, the competition in the area became increasingly severe, especially for African American workers. Most employers of manufacturing firms were white, which explained the fact that White American workers had an easier time finding jobs than their African American counterparts. In fact, the Black-male-jobless rate in residential areas of South Central hovered around 50% during the 1980s (Gooding-Williams, 128). The African American workers' frustration over poverty and unemployed, combined with the openly hostile attitude of White American employers and workers, worsened the relationship between the two races.

The racial tension was not limited to African American and White American communities. There were also Hispanic-Black conflict and Latino-White conflict. During the 1970s and 1980s, the population of Hispanic in the South Central Area increased significantly. If unemployment was the main problem for the African American community, low-paying and undesirable jobs in competitive sector industries were the central problem for Latino community. With incomes below the poverty level, Latino residents would inevitably have hostility towards African American and White American workers in the area.

Outrage swept the nation when the verdict of the Rodney King trial was revealed. According to Nancy Ablemann who recounted the event, “In many parts of the United States, angry demonstrations, civil disobedience, rioting, and looting broke out [...] demonstrations and disturbances rocked urban centers” (Ablemann, 2); however, nowhere was the violence more pronounced than in Los Angeles. The damage in Los Angeles alone resulted in approximately 58 dead, 2,400 injured, 11,400 arrested, and $717 million in damages.

When one takes into account the history of the minorities in South Central and their present conditions, it is not surprising why the rioters reacted the way they did. The people lying on the ground in the picture, with their arms tied behind their backs, were just ordinary people. The man wearing colorful shorts would easily fit into a college campus scene, and the woman kneeling was wearing an apron, probably coming home from work. These normal citizens were not gangsters or degenerates. They were merely civilians who were unhappy with their situation and were trying to be heard.

One of the most curious intrigues about the Los Angeles Riots was the relationship between the police and the citizens. In the picture above, the photographer wanted to truly capture this relationship. Racial tensions pervaded the area throughout the preceding decade. Residents constantly complained about racial profiling and believed that police targeted minorities. This picture supports that notion, depicting the police as authority figures attempting to subjugate minorities.

Looking at the situation from a different perspective, the police had very few options. The residents complained that police constantly watch the area and specifically target minorities. But what other choice did they have? Most violent crimes took place in the inner city, not in communities like Beverly Hills. It was completely reasonable for the police to patrol the ghettos because that was where the crime continued to occur.

In the wake of the Rodney King Riots, sociologist Steve Herbert followed members of the Los Angeles Police Department in an effort to learn about their thought process and how they interpreted their surroundings. He concluded that police officers declared certain spaces “pro-police and anti-police.” When officers felt that they were entering a pro-police area like Beverly Hills or Hollywood, they would be much more relaxed and more likely to listen to residents in an effort to reconcile their problems; however, when the police entered an anti-police area, they are significantly more nervous and quicker to arrest people that will threaten their safety. When someone enters an area in which they feel threatened, they are more likely to respond with force. This picture attempts to portray the police as the aggressors who subjugated the population, when in reality they were dealing with rioters and looking out for their own safety.

The actions taken by rioters during the Rodney King Riots of 1992 were largely caused by the prevalent social injustice, poor education, and high unemployment rates present in Los Angeles. Looking deeper, the revolts that took place were not only racial protests against bad local conditions, but also an encouragement for the coming generation of young African Americans to directly confront the racial inequality they may experience in the future. The relationship between the rioters and the police force is also to blame. The different perceptions from the two opposing sides led to conflict rather than resolution. If there was not such a large misunderstanding between the two, then things may not have escalated as much as they did.
